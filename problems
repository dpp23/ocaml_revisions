Problems & feautures yet to implement:

-Revisions not actually isolated
-Can read & write outside a fork
-Not keeping track of the original value of the Isolated 
-No use of the merge function (see above)
-Still sequential
-Move from two functors to just one?
-Duplicates in the list of dirty IDs in the revisions, Use better data structure?



(int, var, 'a) Map.t * int list -> isolated -> var -> (int, var, 'a) Map.t * int list
t -> isolated -> var -> t
