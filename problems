Problems & features yet to implement:

-Revisions not actually isolated (should somehow limit writes to forks)
-Can read & write outside a fork
-Not keeping track of the original value of the Isolated 
-No use of the merge function (see above)
-Still sequential
-Move from two functors to just one?
-Duplicates in the list of dirty IDs in the revisions, Use better data structure?
-ID of Isolated kept both in the map keys and in the map values, perhaps only keep the values of the Isolated in the map?
